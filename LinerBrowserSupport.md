# WebCrypto-Liner Browser Support
Each browser supports a different set of cryptographic algorithms and capabilities. WebCrypto-Liner tries to mask these differences with Javascript implementations of the various algorithms and datastructures. 

There are a few things to keep in mind:
- Wherever possible the native implementations are used,
- Some features, such as non-exportable keys, can not be implemented in Javascript,
- Size is a concern so although it is possible to implement some export formats we have decided not to.
