# webcrypto-liner - A polyfill for WebCrypto that "smooths out" the rough-edges

Though WebCrypto is well [supported accross browsers](http://caniuse.com/cryptography), several browsers still have prefixed and buggy implementations. Additionally they do not always support the same algorithms, for example Edge does not support SHA1 or ECC while both Firefox and Chrome do. 

**NOTE**: If your not familiar with how to use the various capabilities of WebCrypto see [this great example  page](https://github.com/diafygi/webcrypto-examples).

`webcrypto-liner` is a wrapper for WebCrypto designed to address these issues, at the same time it was designed to be modular so that it can also be used for testing the addition of new algorithms to WebCrypto in the future.

Intentionally `webcrypto-liner` does not implement any cryptography though it does consume libraries that does. We strongly recomend you read "[Whatâ€™s wrong with in-browser cryptography?](https://tonyarcieri.com/whats-wrong-with-webcrypto)" before using this library.

The libraries `webcrypto-liner` relies on for cryptographic implementations include:

| Package                                         | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| [jsSHA](https://github.com/Caligatio/jsSHA)     | A JavaScript implementation of the complete Secure Hash Standard family     |
| [elliptic](https://github.com/indutny/elliptic) | Fast Elliptic Curve Cryptography in plain javascript                        |
| [jrsasign](https://kjur.github.io/jsrsasign/)   | A pure Javascript library implementing RSASSA-PKCS1-v1_5, RSA-PSS & RSA-OAEP |
|                                                 |                                                                             |

`webcrypto-liner` will always try to use a native implementation of webcrypto, or a prefixed version of webcrypto, before it falls back to a Javascript implementation of a given algorithm. We have no control over the corresponding implementation and what it does, for example it may not use `window.crypto.getRandomValues` even if it is available and the mechanism it uses to gather randomness may be both insecure and weak.

At this time our goal is to enable interopability, at a later date we will revisit the implementation of these third-party libraries and determine our level of confidence in them. **YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED**.

To keep `webcrypto-liner` as small as possible it was designed to be modular, if you do not need ECC support, do not include `elliptic` as a dependency and it will not be loaded.

If you do not load any of the dependencies that provide cryptographic implementations `webcrypto-liner` will work as an interopanility layer, very similar to [webcrypto-shim](https://github.com/vibornoff/webcrypto-shim).

## Important
This library is not ready for consumption, we have more work to do, including samples, amongst other things.

## Dependencies
typescript
```
npm install typescript --global
```

## Compilation 
Compile the source code using the following command:
```
tsc
```
Compile the source code with declaration using the next command:
```
tsc --declaration
```
